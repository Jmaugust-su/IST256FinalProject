Final Reflection:
There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works. (Alan J. Perlis) I spotted this quote online and it made me think of all the fun we had this semester, one thing I can do is break code. When you told, us we had to write a reflection paper, I looked at my team and smiled. Finally, something I understand and can do hands down! No bashing my head against the proverbial wall and not wanting to toss the laptop like a frisbee. I asked for each of them to give me some input and here is what they each said. 
Eddie writes: 
“The final project for Python was definitely one of the toughest projects I've ever had to collaborate on. Although I had difficulty understanding several concepts as the class progressed, I was able to put the pieces together after many trials and errors. Being able to come up with an idea was perhaps the easiest part of the project, and making it come to life was certainly challenging. There were many bumps along the road it was extremely rewarding in the end to have a working program. 
From this class, the concept that I will carry with me the most is the use of functions, even though I still have a lot to work on, mainly because of how beneficial and convenient it is when it comes to solving problems. In addition, working with individuals who were struggling just as much as me made the final project even more rewarding because we were able to see the final results come to life. 
Overall, this class was pretty challenging but now I can say I took on python and I survived.” 
Amen to that Eddie! Knowing that there were others who were struggling as much as I was, well that was rewarding in and of itself. It was comforting to know I wasn’t alone in the class. 
Khadija had some different thoughts: 
“This project demonstrated the benefits of coding to me. Before this course and project, I didn’t see the purpose of learning how to code because it seemed so difficult. However, learning how to debug and conceptualize code in a line by line manner made me want to explore what else I could do with Python beyond this course. 
The final project provided insight into the development process of a program and working with other developers. There are many ways to approach code and get the same output, so at times it was difficult understanding other people’s code or why they chose the approach they did. Then by the end of the project, I had learned different methods that my classmates had picked up on that I hadn’t. 
Working in a group of four was also helpful when one of us hit a wall with an error or output. It was also very rewarding when the program finally did work the way we had imagined. In researching solutions, I was also exposed to more advanced methods I would like to learn.”
Once again Khadija, like Eddie before her hits the nail on the head! Our time together was very rewarding and we did learn a lot. Both in the class and from one another.
John spent many an evening leaning over and coaching me to help me get through the homework or a lab. John writes in his reflection: 
“IST 256 was my first real introduction to coding in any sense. Python provided a technical challenge for me that I feel you do not often get in other IST courses. It was an opportunity to learn a vital new skill while also working to understand the material. 
I appreciated the opportunity that this project provided, because it forced me to apply the concepts that I had learned in class in order to succeed. This often meant spending many late nights stubbornly working with code in order to get my desired outcome. The trial and error process helped me understand the patience required in coding. Python also reminded me not to over complicate or over think the problems presented to me. I often found that Occam’s Razor-esque approached best when working with Python and that the simplest answer was right in front of me the whole time. 
I hope to continue learning Python in the future, and that the iSchool plans to offer more advanced classes as well.” 
So, one last time- “Hey Nick, you with me?” Those famous words that would begin many an agonizing evening or morning for me as I struggled to code. Now, I had experience with coding already in my college career. Simply put- I was already put off and angry when I walked into the class. When we were told about a group project, I groaned internally. I hate group projects. 
Walking into any class is intimidating to me. I am competing against those younger than I who have much more technical background. I always feel I need to prove something to the younger students. I remember the first night with butterflies in my stomach asking Eddie or Khadija to plug in my laptop to the wall. Little did I know that between the ladies and John they would open my eyes to a larger world. 
We worked together early on and they helped me as much as I felt I was helping them. They helped me learn to code! When we received the okay to form a group I was psyched!  I found myself looking forward to our group meetings and chats. For the first time in my college career I was working with high caliber students who won over my respect, they worked as hard or harder than I did on the project. They taught me with the right group you can do anything! I wish that they weren’t graduating and had a couple more semesters to go because I would take classes with them and work on a team with them in a heartbeat. If I am ever a manager somewhere and they need a job all they will need to do is call and I will hire them on the spot! 
Finally, I need to make Nick’s head swell. 
Honestly, I never realized this was your first-time teaching. Nick, you were simply awesome. Can I code today? Eh...maybe.... Yet I can read code and understand code! That means I came a long way in a short while and it was thanks to you. With the right teacher, anyone can be taught and you were the right man for this job for me! 
For Khadija, Eddie, and myself we now see the value behind the class and I think that was the point. For John, it was an exposure to a new world that he is going to continue to explore. In the end, we all walked away from one of the hardest classes we have ever taken with a new appreciation for each other and the class content.
